# Loop Generator
This console application can be used for practicing basic programming test questions related to variables, operators, if statements and for loops in C++. All variables and operators are randomly generated.

I had initial ambitions to add higher difficulty levels by creating problems with more nested if statements and loops, and was trying to design the code to make it easier to scale with these higher difficulty levels. However, I stopped working on this that after a certain point, as problems were already becoming extremely difficult to solve.

To run this application, simply open the .sln file (located in the project root) in Visual Studio and press Local Windows Debugger.
